# CS225-FinalProject

## Data

We are using [San Francisco Road Network Data](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm) and working with the following two datasets:

- [San Francisco Road Network's Nodes](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/research/tpq/SF.cnode)

- [San Francisco Road Network's Edges](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/research/tpq/SF.cedge)

Additionally, we added [San Francisco Police Station data](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Map-of-Police-Stations-2011-/a9xm-jdem) to our existing dataset for reference.
