# Team Contract

## Communication

1.**Team Meetings**

Our team will meet every Saturday @ 4:00 PM. Each meeting will roughly last 1.5 hour via zoom. We will go over goals for the week, as well as working on the weekly dev log entry. Any `issues` discussed in the meetings will be posted in the `issues` tab of the repository, so corresponding team members can work on them, and reference PR to individual issues.

2.**Assistance**

WeChat group will be used as our main form of communiation; email can also work as an alternative. The desired response time is 24 hours apart from emergencies.

3.**Respect**

We will encourage sharing different ideas and are welcoming to any suggestions. All decisions will be made by a majority vote. If a team member is not able to attend a meeting, they will be responsible for informing the team and providing updates on their progress.

## Collaboration

1.**Work Distribution**

At each weekly meeting, we will list all the deliveralbls for group members to choose. If no one chooses, we will randomly assign those work to group members. If we think an uneven distribution of work has occured, we can discuss and make adjustments. For rather large tasks, we will divide them into smaller tasks and assign them to different group members.

2.**Time Commitment**

Each week, each member is expected to work around 3-6 hours for the weekly goal. If a particular deliverable has taken more than those time, work adjustments can be made to mend the situation. It is the team's responsibility to ensure that all deliverables are completed on time, not just one member's. If a member is unable to meet the weekly goal, they will be responsible for informing the team and providing updates on their progress. If a member continues to miss deadlines and/or does not communicate with the team, the team will discuss and decide on a course of action.

3.**Conflict Resolution**

All conflicts with in the team will be discussed by all the members to ensure quality and neutrality. The final decision will be made by a majority vote. If the vote is tied, we would use a random number generator to decide the outcome.
