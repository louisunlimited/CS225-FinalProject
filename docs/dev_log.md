# Dev Log

## Week 1

This week our main goal was to finish all the documentation and figure out a feasible way of implementing our leading questions. We accomplished all of our goals for this week.

Hezi Jiang: I participated in discussing functions and algorithms of our final project, as well as finished the leading questions 2 & 3.

Tianyue Cao: I searched for the graph algorithms for functions one and four. I also calculated the time and space complexities of the graph algorithms.

Louis Qian: This week, I set up the project structure as well as all the files needed for this project. I researched the first and fourth leading questions and made edits. I also tried to incorporate CI into our workflow to make everything go smoothly.

Xiping Sun: I updated data acquisition and finished the team contract. I also joined in the discussion of functions and algorithms.

Everything went smoothly, and we were able to meet all of our goals. One thing that was challenging was figuring out what exactly do we want our proposal question 4 to be like, but thankfully we were able to come up with a good idea and agree on it.

Next week we will officially start our development process and implement Police Training Simulator with DFS. We also want to set up all the function signatures and some of the test cases for this algorithm.
